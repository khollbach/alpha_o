Implement the variable-selecting heuristic of most-colored-tiles-in-row-or-col.
I.e. the value for var (i, j) is
    max(tiles_colored_in_row(i), tiles_colored_in_col(j)).
For this, keep the data updated on every set and unset operation to make
querying it constant time.

The above is working, but isn't generic. Make it generic using the 384 CSP
solver code / handout pseudocode.
